### Currently Working On
<a href="https://github.com/olasubomi4/Autonomous_last_mile_delivery_DRL"> Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Pathfinding in Autonomous Last-Mile Delivery.</a>
This research explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for dynamic pathfinding in autonomous last-mile delivery systems. Traditional routing algorithms like A* and Dijkstra’s are limited in their ability to adapt to real-time environmental changes. DRL offers a promising solution by enabling autonomous agents to learn optimal navigation policies through interaction with a dynamic environment. This study aims to design, implement, and evaluate a DRL-based system in a simulated environment to test its ability to adapt to obstacles, optimize delivery routes, and ensure safety and efficiency.
  

###  About Me

I'm a dedicated Software Engineer currently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at Dublin Business School (Expected Distinction, 2025). I previously worked at **Flutterwave**, a fintech unicorn, where I built real-time scalable services and led critical system migrations.

My passion lies in building **robust distributed systems**, **AI-powered applications**, and **graph-based recommendations**.
